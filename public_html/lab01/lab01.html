    <!--Page requirements. Your page must:
Have a text about the mountain assigned to you.
Have at least two decorative elements. (backgrounds, borders, colours, large fontsâ€¦)
Have a favicon.
Have a title and description.
Have one embedded video or sound. (doesn't have to be about your specific mountain but should be related to mountains or even the outdoors in general)
Have one link to another page related to your assigned mountain.
You cannot use CSS but the style attribute inside HTML tags is allowed and encouraged.
The "retro" look (optional activity):
If you want to give a 1990s "early internet" look, you might want to add a background texture and a midi background music soundtrack.
For background textures, check: https://ihypress.de/textures/ or https://ihypress.de/textureland/
To add a MIDI soundtrack, read this tutorial: https://ihypress.de/midi.php-->

    <h1> Kanjut Sar </h1>
